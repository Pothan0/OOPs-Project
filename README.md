## Overview
This repository contains three algorithms of various domains of shortest path algorithms, encryption algorithms on a large scale dataset
- **RSA encryption algorithm**
- **FloydWarshall algorithm**
- **Page rank algorithm**


### Algorithm 1: RSA Encryption Algorithm 
We use RSA encryption algorithm to encrypt and decrypt messages in the form of string 



### Algorithm 2: Shortest path finding algorithm 
We use FloydWarshall algorithm to find shortest paths across 128 cities in North america in which we have a 128x128 adjacency matrix representing  the distances across the cities



### Algorithm 3: Page rank algortihm
We used Google's Page rank algorithm to measure the importance of a webpage by assigning parameters to it for it we used a dataset of webgraphs containing 7000+ nodes and 10000000+ edges
